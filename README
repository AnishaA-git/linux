2.	Steps adopted to complete the assignment
a)	Install virt-manager
b)	Created the inner VM by following the steps in virt manager for testing
c)	Did the following to build kernel
    a.	sudo bash
    b.	apt-get install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache bison flex libelf-dev
    c.	uname -a 
    d.	cp /boot/config-5.4.52-generic ./.config 
    e.	make oldconfig 
    f.	make && make modules && make install && make modules_install 
    g.	Reboot
d)	Fixed the error after reboot : “UUID does not exist” by doing the following steps
    a.	From GRUB menu selected the older version and booted the system
    b.	Sudo apt-get clean
    c.	Df -h to make sure filesystems on disk are not 100%
    d.	sudo update-initramfs -k 5.9.0+ -u
    e.	Reboot again
e)	Get the inner VM ready to test by following the below steps
    a.	sudo apt-get install cpuid
    b.	If it says E: Unable to locate package cpuid, then do the following
    c.	Check if package is available for the ubuntu version
    d.	Run the below command to get the codename
        i.	lsb_release -a
        ii.	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ lsb_release -a
        iii.	No LSB modules are available.
        iv.	Distributor ID:        Ubuntu
        v.	Description:        Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
        vi.	Release:        20.04
        vii.	Codename:        focal

    e.	Check in there if package is available and in which repository
    f.	https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=cpuid&searchon=names&suite=focal&section=all

    g.	sudo add-apt-repository “repository name”
    h.	sudo apt-get update
    i.	sudo apt-get install cupid

3.	Questions
    a.	Does the number of exits increase at a stable rate?
       No, the number of exits does not increase at a stable rate, however they increase randomly.
    b.	Are there more exits performed during certain VM operations?
       Yes, more exits are performed during certain VM operations like opening a browser or opening a file or performing any other operations. 
    c.	Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
       Approximately ~1000000 many exits are performed during a full VM boot entail, which is calculated by taking the difference between number of exits before and after the reboot.




Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
